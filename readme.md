# SearchFor
This is a simple SublimeText plugin that allows you to search for the selected text.
It will open your default webbrowser and search for the selected text.

##### Future plan:
* Add support for different search engines.
* Add support to open queries in user specified browser.
* Use the built-in popup api?

##### Note:
Only Google is supported as of now.
